## Problem Statement
Behavior Classification: Develop a model to classify a subset of annotated behaviors from accelerometer data. This task involves creating a sophisticated algorithm to accurately identify different behaviors based on data patterns.

## Installation
Ensure matplotlib and scikit-learn are installed using: 
pip install matplotlib cikit-learn

## Running
To run our model first our notebooks should be uploaded into the ML_Hackathon folder and then the notebooks below can be ran.

## Notebooks
- The working model is in "Models/FinalModel-Decision Trees" folder in a notebook called "working_best_model.ipynb"
- There are multiple test notebooks:
  - "Models/KNN" there is a notebook testing a K-nearest neighbour model
  - "Models/NeuralNetwork" there is a notebook testing a knn model, a neural network model and a decision tree model
  - "Models/RandomForest" there is a notebook testing a random forest model
